### Data Flow Architecture

#### Primary Data Flows

1. **Content Generation Flow**
   ```
   User Request → Brand Validation → Freepik Integration → 
   Asset Generation → Compliance Check → Platform Variants → 
   Approval Workflow → Final Publishing
   ```

2. **Brand Compliance Flow**
   ```
   Brand Profile Setup → Template Creation → Content Generation → 
   Automated Validation → Scoring → Manual Review (if needed) → 
   Compliance Analytics
   ```

3. **Analytics Collection Flow**
   ```
   Published Content → Platform Performance Data → 
   Metrics Calculation → Analytics Storage → 
   Reporting Dashboard → Performance Insights
   ```

### Performance Optimization Strategy

#### Indexing Strategy

1. **Primary Access Patterns**
   - Organization-scoped queries (all major tables)
   - User activity tracking (activity logs)
   - Brand compliance queries (generated assets)
   - Time-series analytics (performance data)

2. **Index Types Implemented**
   - **B-tree indexes**: Primary keys, foreign keys, sorting
   - **Partial indexes**: Active records only
   - **Composite indexes**: Multi-column query patterns
   - **GIN indexes**: JSONB fields, full-text search
   - **Covering indexes**: Reduced table lookups

#### Query Optimization Features

1. **Materialized Views**: Pre-computed aggregations
2. **Expression Indexes**: Computed field optimization
3. **Partitioning Ready**: Time-based partitioning for high-volume tables
4. **Connection Pooling**: Optimized for high-concurrency access

### Scalability Considerations

#### Horizontal Scaling
- Read replica configuration for analytics queries
- Application-level sharding support
- CDN integration for asset delivery
- Background job processing distribution

#### Vertical Scaling Thresholds
- CPU utilization > 70% sustained
- Memory utilization > 80%
- Disk I/O wait time > 10ms average
- Connection pool utilization > 80%

### Security and Compliance

#### Data Protection
- Row-level security for multi-tenant isolation
- Encrypted fields for sensitive configuration data
- Comprehensive audit logging
- API rate limiting and quota enforcement

#### Backup and Recovery
- Point-in-time recovery (PITR) configuration
- Automated daily backups
- Cross-region backup replication
- Disaster recovery procedures

### Integration Points
